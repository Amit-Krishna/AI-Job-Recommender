AE Studio builds products, platforms, and internal ventures that increase agency for all conscious beings. We combine world-class software engineering, AI expertise, and product design to ship ambitious projects that matter.
About the Role

As a Data Scientist at AE Studio, you’ll work on a mix of client projects and internal research initiatives. You’ll solve real-world problems, help build meaningful products, and contribute to groundbreaking AI alignment research. Your work will involve building data-driven solutions, leveraging machine learning models, and using your creativity to deliver results that matter.

In addition to client projects, you’ll have the opportunity to propose and pursue high-impact research projects, especially those aligned with our mission of increasing agency. Promising projects could even become prioritized skunkworks initiatives.

We want problem-solvers who are adaptable, collaborative, and excited to push boundaries. If this sounds like you, let’s talk.
About You

You thrive on solving challenging problems and bring a mix of technical expertise, creativity, and humor to your work. You enjoy working independently but also love collaborating with a team that shares your passion for making a difference.
Required Skills and Experience
• Fluency in Python..
• Experience with LLM lifecycle: prompt design/engineering, prompting techniques (RAG, few-shot, CoT, etc.), vector databases, multimodality, fine-tuning, and evaluation.
• Proven data science experience: You’ve been a key contributor to impactful projects and know how to deliver results with real-life outcomes.
• Statistical & causal ML fundamentals: expertise in experimental design, uncertainty quantification, and rigorous model evaluation across tabular, time-series, and foundation-model fine-tuning tasks.
• Deep learning experience: Expertise in building/training NLP or computer vision models with PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX.
• Agile & AI-powered development: You run lean Kanban/Scrum cycles and leverage AI-powered tools like Cursor to prototype quickly and ship high-impact solutions.
• Growth mindset: You embrace challenges, value progress over perfection, and constantly seek to improve.
• Self-management: You can work independently, take ownership of projects, and deliver without constant oversight.
• Product and UX understanding: You care about delivering a seamless, user-friendly experience.
• Effective communication in English: Clear, concise, and maybe even witty communication is essential.
Bonus Points for
• Self-managed projects: Ideally something that you helped develop from zero and shipped to real users.
• Startup experience: You thrive in dynamic environments and enjoy taking on new challenges.
• Client relationship management: Experience managing clients and delivering excellent results.
• Passion for AI alignment: You care deeply about humanity’s future and want to help navigate the challenges of advancing AI.
What We Offer
• Remote-first culture: Work from anywhere, or join us in one of our offices.
• Flexible schedules: We care about outcomes, not micromanagement.
• Competitive pay: Regular performance-based raises and a diversified employee equity program.
• Opportunities for growth: Work on cutting-edge R&D and propose projects that could become our next skunkworks focus.
• Supportive environment: A team that collaborates, mentors, and shares knowledge.
• Perks: Health insurance, free lunches (at the office), weekly knowledge-sharing talks, and an annual team retreat.

Equity

Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich.

At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0.

Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer.

We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity.
• Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do.",Built In Los Angeles

Software Engineer,Senior Software Engineer II - Ecosystem,Kit,Anywhere,"Kit is an email-first operating system for creators who mean business. We help creators grow and monetize their audience with ease. For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn't a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products — all within one platform.

More importantly, there isn't a team more committed to helping creators earn a living. We're on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform. We have always been 100% independent and 100% remote.

We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we look for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our mission, vision, and values to join our team. We're also embracing AI thoughtfully — both in how we build and how we hire to ensure our team is adaptable, innovative, and ready for what's next.

The role

We're looking for a Senior Software Engineer II to lead the evolution of our extensibility and automation platform that powers how creators customize Kit to their unique needs.

You'll be joining the Ecosystem team, which owns the Kit App Store, developer platform (APIs, plugins, webhooks, OAuth), and automation suite that enables creators to build sophisticated, automated marketing systems. We're a newly forming team tackling both legacy modernization and greenfield opportunities, so your enthusiasm for building resilient teams and transforming brown-field systems into elegant solutions is essential.

You're a full-stack, product-minded engineer with deep expertise in Ruby on Rails and React, not content with just shipping features but playing the long game. You see our developer platform not as a technical requirement but as the foundation that empowers thousands of creators to extend Kit in ways we haven't imagined. You combine technical depth with leadership and extreme ownership, partnering closely with Product and Design to shape both the ""what"" and the ""how"". You thrive in ambiguity, take initiative without waiting for permission, and elevate everyone around you through your generosity and optimism.

Most importantly, you understand that great developer experiences create compounding value: when we make it easier for others to build on Kit, we accelerate the entire creator ecosystem.

Your support system

You'll report to the Engineering Manager who leads the Ecosystem team, a cross-functional product team at Kit. You'll collaborate closely with a Product Manager, Product Designer, and peer Software Engineers.

You’ll also have access to a group of Engineers across Kit for support and mentorship, and will start with a peer onboarding buddy who will help you navigate our systems and codebase.

What you'll do
• First Week: Dive into our codebase and extensibility and automation architecture. Set up your local environment and merge your first production code. Take part in Get To Know You's to meet our distributed team.
• First Month: Work through your personal onboarding plan. Begin understanding how Kit App Store supports creators from small to large, and identify opportunities for improvement. Join team activities for planning, building, and measuring the experiences we ship to creators. Actively participate in code reviews, and contribute PRs weekly.
• First Six Months: Lead and architect at least one major feature from ambiguous idea to launch. Transform our legacy codebase through strategic refactoring while applying systems thinking to enhance scalability and maintainability. Drive adoption of patterns and conventions that elevate team-wide technical standards. Ensure service reliability by participating in on-call rotations. Present at least one Lunch & Learn session. Actively mentor peers, and champion quality across our codebase.

What will S.E.T. you up for success
Skills
• Deep expertise developing full-stack web applications using both Ruby on Rails and React, with a track record of owning features end to end
• Ability to write high-quality, well-tested, performant, and accessible code that balances speed of delivery with long term maintainability with minimal guidance
• Support strategic product decisions by anticipating business needs and translating them into technical solutions
• Communicate highly effectively across Engineering, Product, and Design to maintain alignment and momentum across complex initiatives
• Champion technical health through proactive monitoring, creating dashboards and alerting systems that identify issues early and drive systematic improvements
• Ability to lead without authority, aligning teams on goals, trade-offs, and success criteria

Experiences
• Led major cross-team initiatives from ambiguous requirements to successful delivery with measurable business impact
• Modernized and improved existing systems through hands-on brown-field development
• Made data-driven decisions throughout the product development lifecycle
• Worked transparently by sharing progress, learnings, and seeking feedback early and often
• Delivered features that directly impacted customer success and business goals

Traits
• Model continuous growth while developing others through mentorship, code reviews, and deliberate knowledge sharing
• Balance pragmatism with strategic thinking, creating clarity and momentum for teams in uncertainty
• Champion creative execution by breaking down complex challenges into achievable steps others want to follow
• Pioneer AI adoption strategies that thoughtfully balance experimentation with practical team enablement
• Act as a force multiplier by building systems, tools, and knowledge-sharing practices that make the entire team more effective
• Shape and champion solutions that deeply align with user needs, balancing technical excellence with product impact

Nice to haves

You will stand out if you have:
• Designed and scaled frameworks used by developers, like RESTful API platforms with versioning or OAuth app scopes
• Established thought leadership through conference talks, technical blogs, or significant OSS contributions
• Built successful products or partnerships within the creator economy ecosystem

What won't set you up for success
• Struggling to operate in evolving problem spaces without established processes or guardrails
• Preferring to work solo or stay purely technical
• Needing full consensus or permission before moving forward
• Uncomfortable with direct feedback culture (both giving and receiving)
• Prioritizing technical perfection over pragmatic business solutions

Working hours and location

We're 100% remote with team members across the globe. We work mostly on East Coast time—so if you're based on the West Cost of the United States, Europe, or Asia, you might have a few early mornings or late evenings. We do our best to keep things reasonable, but a little time zone juggling comes with the territory.

Compensation + perk + benefits

Kit has standardized salaries based on position, no matter where you live. For this role, we’re hiring at our level L4 ($181,000/year). Level is determined based on experience and our interview process.

Perks + benefits include:
• Profit Sharing
• Kit equity
• 401k with a 5% match
• We cover up to $1,950 per month toward medical premiums, with dental and vision premiums fully covered. We offer Health Insurance plans through Aetna.

• Ten (10) paid holidays a year
• Two weeks of paid sick time each year, including mental health + well being days
• Twelve (12) weeks paid parental leave and flexible scheduling in your child’s first year
• Up to six weeks of paid bereavement leave, medical leave, and disaster after six months of employment, two weeks of each paid leave in your first six months
• Winter Break Closure: Kit closes for a week at the end of December, giving everyone a collective break to enjoy the holiday season. Essential support services remain available, with teams coordinating to ensure coverage during this period
• Four-week, paid sabbatical after five years with the team
• Fantastic in-person or virtual retreats with the team twice a year

How to apply

We know that most people hate interviewing (we relate!). We aim to make it as good of an experience as we can, and part of that includes keeping you informed during the process.

Here’s what you can expect from the process:
• A phone screen with our recruiter
